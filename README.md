A web app that converts things! This was a test to test my basic javascript, css, and html skills as well as make myself better!

Things to implement:
-Freedom units to celsius
-lbs to kgs
-oz to gallons
- 1 mile = 5,280 ft = 1,760 yards = 1,609.34 m = 1.609 km.
- Capacity conversions. 1 gallon = 4 quarts = 8 pints = 16 cups = 3.785 liters
- cooking stuff?
